# Creature Simulator

This is a simple Python application that allows creatures (independently thinking AI agents) to be created using simple instructions stored in a text file. Those creatures can then be added to a world defined in another text file, and a simulation can be run which allows the user to observe the life and death struggle of their creations.

## Features

Beyond the given specifications for this assignment, a few things were added:

* Various intelligent creatures, e.g. a creature named "Mimic" that can exhibit the behaviour of various other creatures
* A lookup table based design which allows new instructions to be easily added
